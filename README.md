# DEV261 - Build Cloud-Native Extensions for SAP Solutions Based on Kubernetes

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called DEV261 - Build Cloud-Native Extensions for SAP Solutions Based on Kubernetes. 

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to using the "SAP Cloud Platfor, Kyma runtime" which is the cloud-native runtime part of SAP Cloud Platform. It makes it easy for developers to get started deploying highly scalable workloads containerized in Docker by providing a set of tools within Kyma runtime:
* **Built-in Service Mesh:** Service-to-service communication and proxying 
* **Built-in Serverless engine:** Build lightweight use cases with serverless functions
* **Event Hub:** React to applicationsâ€™ business events
* **API Gateway:** Expose securely APIs of built apps
* **Service Catalog:** Easy instantiation and consumption of services made available to the runtime

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are:
- [ ] Have a Kyma runtime deployed in your SAP Cloud Platform account ([trial](http://a.com) or CPEA-based [account](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/05/13/sap-cloud-platform-extension-factory-kyma-runtime-how-to-get-started/)). **This will take 1-2 hours to complete!**
- [ ] Have `kubectl`installed on your local machine following [this tutorial](http://a.com)

To make full use of this hands-on session, the following tools shoud be ready as well:
- [ ] [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed with a valid public account
- [ ] [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
- [ ] [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed

If you can't install the above tools, we can show you how to follow the tutorial via the Kyma runtime console UI. Though you can complete each step, you will miss to learn how to make use of Kyma runtime. 

## Exercises

Let's get started with the exercises! As we will focus on bilding an extension case for an SAP application via Kyma runtime, you will start by simulating an application to be connected to your SAP Cloud Platform Global Account and pair it with Kyma runtime. Then you will continue step-by-step to deploy a microservice, bind it to an event, and deploy a UI to the extension. Lastly, we will show you how to make use of other SAP Cloud Platform services within Kyma runtime.
